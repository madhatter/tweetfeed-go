# tweetfeed

tweetfeed searches the twitter stream for defined hashtags and generates a rss feed (XML file) for your
reading pleasures in your feedreader.

This is a rewrite project to practice go coding from my old [Ruby
project](https://github.com/madhatter/tweetfeed). So it's work in progress and
not ready for use yet.
